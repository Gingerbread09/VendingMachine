# Vending Machine Simulation

This project is a simple **Vending Machine Simulation** implemented in Java. The simulation allows users to interact with a virtual vending machine by inserting money, selecting products, and making purchases. The program handles various functionalities, such as checking product stock, ensuring sufficient funds for a transaction, and issuing refunds when the user finishes their session.

## Features
